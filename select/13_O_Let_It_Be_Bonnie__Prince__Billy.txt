What's on the other side of the big looking hill
Gather your courage gather your free will
Go over yondah and catch you a look
At what made us get up at what made us tremble and shook

I can do without it
I can always shout it
Let me be myself

I pick the flowers smell like a bull
Sniff at the summer a round nostril full
Your head disappears on over the rise
And then I seize upon the time that it buys

I can do without it
I can always shout it
Know let it be so

Slip off my old clothes and into a suit
Dance all around try to recruit
The grass to my cause splash to your memory
Exiting finally your bestial gallery

I can live without it
I can always shout it
Let it be
