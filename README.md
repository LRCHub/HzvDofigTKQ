[00:14.11] When I find myself in times of trouble
[00:17.50] Mother Mary comes to me
[00:20.67] Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
[00:26.86] And in my hour of darkness
[00:29.39] She is standing right in front of me
[00:33.41] Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
[00:38.90] Let it be, let it be
[00:42.29] Let it be, let it be
[00:46.56] Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
[00:52.97] And when the broken-hearted people
[00:56.37] Living in the world agree
[00:59.61] There will be an answer, let it be
[01:06.09] For though they may be parted
[01:09.05] There is still a chance that they will see
[01:12.86] There will be an answer, let it be
[01:18.91] Let it be, let it be
[01:22.30] Let it be, let it be
[01:26.27] Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
[01:32.51] Let it be, let it be
[01:35.67] Let it be, let it be
[01:39.85] Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
[01:56.85] 
[02:27.32] Let it be, let it be
[02:30.78] Ah, let it be, yeah, let it be
[02:35.37] Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
[02:42.36] And when the night is cloudy
[02:45.09] There is still a light that shines on me
[02:49.51] Shine until tomorrow, let it be
[02:56.31] I wake up to the sound of music
[02:59.00] Mother Mary comes to me
[03:03.47] Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
[03:09.09] Yeah, let it be, let it be
[03:12.99] Let it be, yeah, let it be
[03:17.19] Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
[03:23.49] Let it be, let it be
[03:26.93] Ah, let it be, yeah, let it be
[03:31.33] Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
