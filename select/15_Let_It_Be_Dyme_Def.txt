(When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be)
A victim of the man
That substitutes his mouth for his hands
So when he talks, you hear a blam, damn
See, my father figured that
My mom should be the father figure
And he'll leave with some bottled liquor
But my mom never stopped the nigga
Until he'll pop for a quickie
Then she'll call for the cops to get him
And I'm like one, two, one, two is this mic on?
'Cause y'all ain't feeling the song
What I'm feeling is wrong
Hey, Dad, you ain't still in the wrong
But a young man's aging and you still ain't called
I'm so stressed that I really need a plaque
And I cherish my mom, and it's nice to you, Black
I'm sorry, D-Black, you might have lost your mom
But you gained a family in return and you learn
You can always let it be, but you never let it burn
I'm just hoping it won't be my turn
So let it go like,
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
And when I get to three
I'ma let it all go and let it be (Be)
I'ma let it all go and let it be (Be)
Three
See, now on a different note, she's singing
But I'm hearing different notes with every different quote
I'm tryin' tell her I love her but she don't listen
And when I try to spend time, she ends up missing
The only thing that's stopping me from cheating
Is the only thing that's stopping her from leaving (Love)
But I don't know if that's there anymore
'Cause I find myself staring at whores
And she finds herself closer to doors
So how can that work?
But this ain't even the song
This is just for you to hear what's wrong
That's what I'm telling my mom
But she knew all along (Why can't we all get along?)
Stuck on a he said, she said, I said, you said
I'm so confused I think I didn't say it
Got a tight grip but I might slip
It's funny how life hits
'Cause Cupid just might miss
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
And when I get to three
I'ma let it all go and let it be (Be)
I'ma let it all go and let it be (Be)
Three
(Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be)
I'm at a point in my life
That the main issue is trying to have a joint in my life
They point at my life and laugh
See, I got two jobs and I'm still broke
See, I got bad asthma and I still smoke
The doctor tellin' me that my breathing's getting worse
And soon I won't be able to spit a verse, now I'm feeling cursed
No turning to my dad 'cause he's too far to look for
So instead I look forward, but I don't look forward to seeing him
At nights I still have bad dreams of being him
People say, "You look just like your dad
You got his laugh, you got his walk, you got his talk."
But I don't got his heart
No, I'm much stronger
My armor is tough for Hussein to drop a bomb on it
The enemy is really myself
The enemy is really what made me help somebody out
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two
And when I get to three
I'ma let it all go and let it be (Be)
I'ma let it all go and let it be (Be)
Three
