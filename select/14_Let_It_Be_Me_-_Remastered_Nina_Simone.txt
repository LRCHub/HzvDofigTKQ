He's my brother
And we gonna leave you with this one

God bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

Each time I see you, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be?

So never leave me lonely
Say that you'll love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

Each time... each time we meet, love
Don't you know I find I see I find I see I find complete love
Oh baby baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby baby baby... and oh...

Don't ever leave me lonely
Say that you'll love me only
Not quiet but almost now and forever let it be me

Now and forever let it be me
