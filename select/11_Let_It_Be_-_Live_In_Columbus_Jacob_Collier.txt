When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in this world of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

When all the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
Though they may be parted,
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let there be an answer, let there be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Oh let it be, oh let it
Be
Thank you
