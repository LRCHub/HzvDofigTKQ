[00:12.51] When I find myself in times of trouble
[00:16.40] Mother Mary comes to me
[00:19.32] Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
[00:36.82] 
[00:25.39] And in my hour of darkness
[00:28.26] She is standing right in front of me
[00:32.03] Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
[00:49.53] 
[00:37.53] Let it be, let it be
[00:40.85] Let it be, let it be
[00:44.90] Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
[01:01.90] 
[00:51.51] And when the broken-hearted people
[00:54.84] Living in the world agree
[00:58.10] There will be an answer, let it be
[01:15.10] 
[01:04.54] For though they may be parted
[01:07.42] There is still a chance that they will see
[01:11.38] There will be an answer, let it be
[01:28.38] 
[01:17.31] Let it be, let it be
[01:20.63] Let it be, let it be
[01:24.52] Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
[01:44.52] 
[01:31.03] Let it be, let it be
[01:34.01] Let it be, let it be
[01:38.04] Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
[01:55.04] 
[02:25.78] Let it be, let it be
[02:28.90] Ah, let it be, yeah, let it be
[02:33.38] Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
[02:50.38] 
[02:40.38] And when the night is cloudy
[02:43.35] There is still a light that shines on me
[02:47.54] Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
[03:04.54] 
[02:54.49] I wake up to the sound of music
[02:58.04] Mother Mary comes to me
[03:01.41] Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
[03:18.91] 
[03:07.69] Let it be, let it be
[03:10.95] Let it be, yeah, let it be
[03:15.12] Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
[03:34.12] 
[03:21.62] Let it be, let it be
[03:24.84] Let it be, yeah, let it be
[03:28.98] There will be an answer, let it be
[03:45.98] 
[03:36.04] Let it be, let it be
[03:39.28] Ah, let it be, yeah, let it be
[03:43.55] Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
